# Introduction:
This file contains three following parts:
1) Code: This part contains following python modules that implement importable functions:

      (a) for a unit converter for feet and yard to meters i.e. unit_converter.py

      (b) that calculate the distance between two adjacent GPS positions i.e. gps_distance.py

      (c) that calculate the direction of motion from the recorded acceleration data i.e. motion_direction.py

      (d) to read out the data and time from each metafile and convert it into unix time i.e. metafile_to_unix.py

      (e) test_.py, it contains run test for unit conversion and gps_distance.
   
2) Data:
         This part contains all the .csv files for data collected for each experiment. And it also has .md file which contains images of motion for every experiment.
   
4) Documentation:
    Documentation contains useful information markdowns including this How To Run document and the references.
