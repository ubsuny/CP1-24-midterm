"""
Unit tests for functions in the `mtcirclefuncts` module.

This module includes tests for:
1. `haversine`: Calculates the great-circle distance between two points on the Earth given their latitude and longitude.
2. `calculate_distances`: Calculates the pairwise distances between multiple GPS coordinates using the haversine formula.
   
The tests use known GPS coordinates to validate the correctness of the distance calculations.
