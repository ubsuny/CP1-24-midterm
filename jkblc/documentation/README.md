Explanation of Functions

    Unit Conversion Functions:
        feet_to_meters(feet): Converts feet to meters.
        yards_to_meters(yards): Converts yards to meters.

    GPS Distance Calculation:
        haversine(coord1, coord2): Calculates the great-circle distance between two coordinates on Earth.

    Motion Direction from Acceleration Data:
        direction_from_acceleration(ax, ay, az): Returns the direction of motion based on acceleration in 3D space.

    Unix Time Conversion Functions:
        convert_to_unix_time(date_string, date_format): Converts a date string to Unix time.
        read_metafile_and_extract_unix(file_path): Reads timestamps from a file and returns them in Unix time.

The Python modules contain all the requested algorithms. It appears that the modules need to be implemented and unit tests have to be written using the pytest framework, with no explicit requirement to test specific external data directly.
