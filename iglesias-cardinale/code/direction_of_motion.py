def velocity(t, a, v_0):
    '''
    This function calculates velocity given a time range, 
    acceleration at each instance of time, and an initial velocity

    Parameters:
    - t: Time values at which we have a defined acceleration and at which we will find the velocity
    - a: acceleration at each time, t
    - v_0: Initial velocity. Generally zero.

    Returns:
    - v: Velocity at each time t

def direction_of_motion(ax,ay,az,t, i):
    '''
    This function plots the direction of motion at a given time, t[i] given acceleration data. 
    The initial velocity is always set to zero. This is to avoid pylint complaining about
    too many positional arguments. 

    Parameters:
    - t: Time values at which we have a defined acceleration and at which we will find the velocity
    - ax: x-acceleration at each time, t
    - ay: y-acceleration at each time, t
    - az: z-acceleration at each time, t
    - i: index of t at which we find the direction of motion

    Returns:
    - 3d plot of normalized vector v
