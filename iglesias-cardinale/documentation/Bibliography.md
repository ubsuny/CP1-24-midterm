In distance.py we calculate the distance between two points on the surface of Earth without the assumption that the Earth is flat. We utilized equations and constants given by the Univerity of South Florida at https://gscommunitycodes.usf.edu/geoscicommunitycodes/public/geophysics/Gravity/earth_shape.php. 

We also used the conversions between spherical and cartesian coordinates given in Jackson, John David, 1925-2016. (1999). Classical electrodynamics. New York :Wiley,

To calculate unix time, we used useful information from https://www.unixtimestamp.com/.
