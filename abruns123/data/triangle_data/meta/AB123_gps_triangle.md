Additional Info: This is the second attempt at making the triangle gps data.
The first attempt that had been done the previous weekend did not turn out
well when plotting. To walk the triangle, I chose the field adjacent to the 
commons on University at Buffalo North Campus and walked from one end to
the other and then walked back to the opposite corner and then back to my
starting position.
