Weather Conditions:
This experiment was indoors, so weather was irrelevant

Additional info: It was hard not to cause a certain amount of perterbation 
in the acceleration reading just by slightly moving my hand as I held my phone.
I held my phone screen facing up to ensure that the Z-axis would represent the 
direction that the elevator was moving in.
